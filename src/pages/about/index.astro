        We work at the intersection of land, design, and delivery.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        Our practice spans three complementary areas — architecture, development,
        and project delivery — allowing us to support projects from early feasibility
        through to construction completion.

          <p>
            We design residential projects with a strong focus on clarity, site responsiveness, and buildability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our architectural work includes new homes, alterations, and small-scale residential developments.
            We optimise sites, test built-form options early, and guide projects through council documentation
            and consent processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Design decisions are grounded in cost awareness and planning realism, ensuring projects are both thoughtful and practical.

            We provide client-side land and project strategy for residential sites.
          </p>

          <p>
            This includes acquisition assessment, yield and density testing, financial feasibility modelling,
            subdivision strategy (typically 3–10 lots), and coordination of planning pathways.
            We structure projects carefully — aligning risk, staging, and programme to support informed decision-making.

            We remain involved beyond design and consent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our delivery role includes contractor management, construction oversight,
            programme monitoring, budget control, procurement interface, and compliance coordination
            through to practical completion. We ensure projects are carried through construction
            with structure and accountability.
