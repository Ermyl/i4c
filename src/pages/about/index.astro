    </h1>

    <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
      We work at the intersection of land, design, and delivery.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
      Our practice spans three complementary areas — architecture, development,
      and project delivery — allowing us to support projects from early feasibility
      through to construction completion.
    </p>

    <!-- Architecture -->
    <div class="mt-12">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">Architecture</h2>

      <div class="mt-2 space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        <p>
          We design residential projects with a strong focus on clarity, site responsiveness, and buildability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our architectural work includes new homes, alterations, and residential developments.
          We optimise sites, test built-form options early, and guide projects through council documentation and consent processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design decisions are grounded in cost awareness and planning realism, ensuring projects are both thoughtful and practical.
        </p>

    <!-- Development -->
    <div class="mt-6">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">Development</h2>

      <div class="mt-2 space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        <p>
          We provide client-side land and project strategy for residential sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This includes acquisition assessment, yield and density testing, financial feasibility modelling,
          subdivision strategy, and coordination of planning pathways.
          We structure projects carefully — aligning risk, staging, and programme to support informed decision-making.
        </p>

    <!-- Delivery -->
    <div class="mt-6">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">Delivery</h2>

      <div class="mt-2 space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        <p>
          We remain involved beyond design and consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our delivery role includes contractor management, construction oversight,
          programme monitoring, budget control, procurement interface, and compliance coordination
          through to practical completion. We ensure projects are carried through construction
          with structure and accountability.
